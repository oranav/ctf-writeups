For challenge 3, you can either:
1. Use the hard-coded value in `find_tricky_rng_seed`, or
2. Install [Bitcoin Cash Node](https://bitcoincashnode.org/) and let it run for a while (so it populates the block index).

Note that it **has to be** Bitcoin Cash, as Bitcoin does not have a suitable block in all of its 650K blocks.

In either case, the script takes a looooooong time to run, but it eventually works.
